Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit
binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not.
The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated
sequence.
Example:
0100,0011,1010,1001
Then the output should be:
1010
```
numbers = input().split(",")

result = []

for num in numbers:
    decimal = int(num, 2)

    if decimal % 5 == 0:
        result.append(num)

print(",".join(result))
```
Write a Python program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of
letters and digits.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world! 123
Then, the output should be:
LETTERS 10
DIGITS 3
```
sentence="hello world! 123"
letters=0
numbers=0
for i in range(len(sentence)):
    if sentence[i].isalpha():
        letters+=1
    elif (sentence[i].isdigit()):
        numbers+=1
print("Letters:", letters)
print("Numbers:", numbers)
```
Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.The
results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single
line.Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:8
Then, the output should be:40320
```
n=int(input())

fact=1

for i in range(1,n+1):
    fact=fact*i

print(fact)
```
